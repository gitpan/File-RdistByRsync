    Version 0.3, Feb 1, 2002

Some command line flags were parsed and then ignored.  For
example, '-m'.

Turns out that rsync has a major bug.  Symbolic links on the
destination are not respected when they are part of a relative
path.  For example, if on the destination /var is a link and
you try to dist over /var/db/pkg, rsync will delete the /var
link and replace it with a directory containing just /var/db...
Not good.  The code now works around this when you dist a 
single thing with an rsync invocation.

Slaven Rezic <rezic@onlineoffice.de> noticed that the 
command wrapper (rdist2rsync) used the old name of the
module (and thus didn't work).  Also the "require 5.6.1"
was moved to Makefile.PL and documented.

    Version 0.1, Jan 08, 2002

Initial release.
